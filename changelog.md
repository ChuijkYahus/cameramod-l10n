- cassette tapes can play independently of one another
- view finders can apply post shaders to their feed. This is done with glass panes or with mob heads when supplementaries is on
- tvs can be connected to form a bigger tv screen, any size works so long its square
- tvs can connect when at most 1 of them has a cassette or none at all
- added 5 new cassettes: nature, channel2, us, axolotl and frogs
- huge internal changes which improve tv rendering logic and rendering pipeline in many different ways
- you can pause a tv by shift clicking
- improved tf shader to have additional effects
- swapped static and color bars textures for missing feed and missing content tv states
- endermen will be angered when looked at through at TV, just like SCP 096. This causes tv to play a static effect.
- added funny live leak easter egg
- added a new music disc, Sojourn by Hlzfss. You get it by killing an enderman angered from a TV
- cassettes can now also be dropped by getting a creeper be killed by a pillager
- added distant horizons compat, making tv scenes not render DH chunks (configurable)
- attempted to add iris compat, some hacks were added and minor improvements obtained but really there's nothing more I can do, trust me I tried too much, Iris is just built not that well and would require compatibility on their end to for once allow people to disable shaders arbitrairly.
- tvs can optionally show the current datetime timestamp
- fixed many, many bugs
