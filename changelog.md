- swapped static and color bars textures for missing feed and missing content tv states
- tvs that have a view finder thats far away and have an active texture will display a pause overlay
- added funny live leak easter egg
- endermen will be angered when looked at through at TV, just like SCP 096
- view finders can apply post shaders to their feed. This is done with glass panes or with mob heads when supplementaries is on
